# MandelbrotSet

The goal of this file is to visualize the Mandelbrot set.
The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers that obey the following condition...
f(z) = z^2 + c

All numbers c that cause the function to be bounded when recursively
applying f to its result beginning with z=0 are in the Mandelbrot set.

Points that fall within the set are colored black. Points outside the set are
colored white.
